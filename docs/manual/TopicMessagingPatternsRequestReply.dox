<p>
The request-reply mechanism is extremely important to UMPS and it is one of UMPS's major improvements over existing seismic processing systems.  Suppose, you are running two instances of a detector - say a P and S-detector - on different machines. The P-detector triggers and a pick is made. How then should you give this pick a unique identification? One solution is to make a request from a service whose entire purpose is to provide unique identifiers. This service could be a database or a standalone program. It does not matter. All that matters is the request can be made by both detectors and the request will be fulfilled by the server.
